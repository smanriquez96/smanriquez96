# 👋 Hi, I’m @smanriquez96, Sebastian Manriquez  

🌍 From Santiago, Chile  

I’m passionate about software development and how technology can make a meaningful impact in the world. Currently, I work as an Engineer Manager, where I lead a talented team of developers to create robust, scalable, and innovative solutions.  

Outside of work, I’m a triathlete who thrives on challenges, whether it's coding a complex system or crossing the finish line in a grueling race. My interests also include:  
- **Professionally**: Software development, human behavior, project management, teamwork efficiency, agile practices, and exploring ways to make coding and collaboration more effective.  
- **Personally**: Sports like football, cycling, running, tennis, and swimming keep me energized and focused.  

💡 I love collaborating on impactful software projects, particularly those that involve data analytics, modeling, and creative engineering solutions. I’m always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and enjoy the journey while achieving professional and personal satisfaction.  

📫 Feel free to reach out at **sebamanriquez96@gmail.com**. Let’s build something amazing together!
